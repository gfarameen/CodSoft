# Password Generator

This Python program generates random passwords based on user preferences. You can choose from different types of passwords, including those composed of digits, letters, special characters, or a mix of all of them.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd password-generator
   ```

3. Run the `password_generator.py` script:

   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to specify the desired length of the password and choose the type of password you want to generate.

5. The program will then generate and display the random password based on your preferences.

## Password Types

You can choose from the following types of passwords:

- All Digits: Password containing only digits (0-9).
- All Letters: Password containing only letters (both uppercase and lowercase).
- Special Characters: Password containing special characters like symbols and punctuation.
- Mix of All: Password containing a mix of digits, letters, and special characters.

### Note:

- Make sure to choose a valid option, and the program will generate a password accordingly.
- Passwords are generated randomly, making them secure and unpredictable.
